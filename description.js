// This is what name you want your ROMs to show up under.
developer: "Conical Roms",
// Your id. This should have no spaces or other funny characters.
// This would ideally be your Github id, so when you send me your manifest
// I can verify who you are. But it can be anything really.
id: "linuxmotion",
// The display summary. Two lines max.
summary: "Source built Roms and themes from LinuxMotion",
// The location of the developer's manifest.
manifest: "http://thelinuxmotion.org/ClockworkMod/manifest.js",

// If you don't support a device, just don't list it!
